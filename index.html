			Transparency is not a word in Moderators' vocabulary. They like to be in shadows so that wrong actions get unnoticed.<br><br>
			Not anymore. Here it is a public tool so that you can make your own arguments based on live data of their activity in Transformice.<br><br>
			A score point is registered every 5 minutes; However it does not mean they were online for 5 minutes, but for within a range from 1 second to 5 minutes.<br>
			To calculate the time in minutes, you may use:<br>
			&emsp;max => (score * 5);<br>
			&emsp;min => score / 100;
